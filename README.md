# Sweet Shop Management System

This project is a Sweet Shop Management System designed to manage sweets, ladoos, pastries, and dessert inventory. Users can browse available sweets, purchase them, and admins can add, update, or delete sweets. The frontend is built with React.js, and the backend is as provided in the original repository.

## Features

- **User Registration & Login:** Users can create accounts and log in to make purchases.
- **View Sweets:** Browse all available sweets with details like name, category, price, and quantity.
- **Search & Filter:** Users can search sweets by name or category (if implemented in frontend).
- **Purchase Sweets:** Users can purchase sweets, reducing available stock.
- **Admin Features:** Admins can add, update, and delete sweets in the inventory.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js  
- **Backend:** Original backend from the repository  
- **Styles:** CSS, custom components for responsive UI

## How to Run Locally

1. Download the repository and unzip it.
2. Navigate to the frontend folder.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   During the development of the Sweet Shop Management System, I leveraged AI tools to improve efficiency and reduce repetitive work. Here is a detailed breakdown:

Tool Used: ChatGPT (OpenAI)

How I Used It:

Generated initial boilerplate code for the FastAPI backend (routes, CORS setup, simple API endpoints).

Created React frontend components including App.jsx and main.jsx structure.

Provided guidance on integrating frontend with backend, including API calls using Axios.

Assisted in troubleshooting errors such as CORS issues, HTTP method mismatches, and frontend runtime errors.

Suggested minimal working solutions under time constraints to ensure a functional demo.

Reflection:
Using AI allowed me to focus on the core functionality and integration logic instead of getting stuck on syntax or boilerplate. It helped me quickly resolve errors and produce a working full-stack application. I manually reviewed, adjusted, and tested all AI-generated code to ensure correctness and learning.
